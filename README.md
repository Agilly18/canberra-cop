# canberra-cop

A common operating picture for Canberra, Australia — live aircraft, weather,
rain radar, and emergency-service incidents on one map. Think Palantir, but
cheap: every data source is free.

## What it shows

- **Aircraft** within 60 NM of Canberra via ADS-B ([airplanes.live](https://airplanes.live)),
  coloured by altitude, military airframes flagged red. 12 s refresh.
- **Current weather** for Canberra ([Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com)).
- **Rain radar** overlay ([RainViewer](https://www.rainviewer.com)).
- **Live emergency incidents** — fires, ambulance callouts, rescues — from the
  [ACT Emergency Services Agency](https://esa.act.gov.au) dispatch feed
  (CC-BY 4.0, updated every 60 s).
- **Traffic flow** ([TomTom](https://developer.tomtom.com), optional) —
  green/amber/red road congestion. Needs a free API key in `.env`
  (`TOMTOM_API_KEY=...`); the layer is off by default and simply stays
  unavailable without one.
- **Fire hotspots** ([NASA FIRMS](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov),
  optional) — VIIRS satellite thermal detections from the last 48 h, sized
  by fire radiative power. Needs a free map key in `.env`
  (`FIRMS_MAP_KEY=...`).
- **NSW fires** — [NSW RFS](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au) major incidents
  around the ACT border region, coloured by official alert level (the
  "Fires Near Me" feed).

## Running it

```sh
python3 serve.py
```

Then open <http://localhost:8899/poc.html>. No dependencies beyond Python 3
and a browser.

(`poc.html` also works opened directly as a file, but the ESA incident layer
needs `serve.py` — the upstream feed sends no CORS headers, so the little
server relays it.)

## Roadmap

- **Phase 2** — proper backend (FastAPI container), Transport Canberra
  GTFS-realtime (live buses/light rail).
- **Phase 3** — alert rules (loitering aircraft, incidents near a watchpoint,
  storm cells inbound), per-decision saved views, time slider.
- **Someday** — a local RTL-SDR receiver as a first-party ADS-B sensor.
